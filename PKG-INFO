Description: mfapy: A Python toolbox for 13C-metabolic flux analysis
    ================================================

    mfapy is a Python toolbox for 13C-metabolic flux analysis developed by Matsuda and Shimizu lab group in Osaka university, Japan.
    mfapy supports:

    1. The elementary metabolite unit (EMU) framework developed by Antoniewicz et al 2007.
    2. Isotopically nonstationary 13C metabolic flux analysis (INST-MFA)
    3. Parallel labeling experiment without limitation of number of experiments.
    4. Metabolic flux, net metabolic flux of reversible reaction, and metabolite concentration could be considered as fitting parameters.
    5. G-value by introducing the "pseudo" reaction
    6. Goodness-of-fit analysis
    7. Parallel performing non-linear optimization jobs using parallel python.
    8. Automated model construction from model description file

    Requirement
    ----------------------------------------
    Python 3.6
    mfapy requires the packages:
    NumPy and SciPy (van der Walt, Colbert & Varoquaux, 2011)
    nlopt https://nlopt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
    joblib
    mkl-service

    mfapy was developed and tested using the PyScripter IDE, and was tested in 64 bit version of Anaconda3 distribution in Windows 10.


    Install
    ----------------------------------------
    1. Install 64 bit version of Anaconda3
    2. Create virtual environment such as named "mfapy" and install required packages
    ~~~
        > conda create -n mfapy python=3.6 numpy scipy matplotlib=2.1 joblib
        > conda activate mfapy
        > conda install -c conda-forge nlopt
        > conda install -c anaconda mkl-service
    ~~~

    2. Install mfapy
    Unzip and set as current folder
    ~~~
        > python setup.py install
    ~~~

    Test
    ----------------------------------------
    ~~~
        > python setup.py test
    ~~~

    How to use
    ----------------------------------------
    Sample python code in 'Explanation_1_13CMFA_toymodel.py' explains how to used mfapy.
    Detailed explanations are available from docstrings
    Example python codes are also available.
