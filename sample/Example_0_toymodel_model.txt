# Definition of metabolic reactions
# 1. id, text
#	Please use alphabet (+ number) as ids. Please do not use space and special characters to avoid unexpected errors.
# 2. Stoichiometry for the construicton of stoichiometry matrix., text
#	All id of metabolites must be defined in //Metabolites
#	Only "+" and "-->" are accpectable separators.
#	Here, expression of reaction using coefficient such as  "Fumx --> {2}OA" is allowed.
#	"nd" means this reaction is an "pseudo" reaction and ignored in the flux calculation by stoichiometry matrix.
# 3. Stoichiometry for the construicton of atom mapping., text
#	Only "+" and "-->" are accpectable separators.
#	Here, expression of reaction without using coefficient is needed such as  "Fumx --> OA+OA" is allowed.
#	"nd" means this reaction is an excretion reaction and ignored in the MDV calculation
# 4. Atom mapping, text
#	Only "+" and "-->" are accpectable separators. Please use A-Z to express carbon atom.
#	"nd" means this reaction is an excretion reaction and ignored in the MDV calculation
# 5. Use or ignore., text
#	Rows insteaed of "use" are ignored in the model construction.
# 6. Lower boundary of metabolic flux level, float
#	Value must be more than zero
# 7. Upper boundary of metabolic flux level, float
#	Value must be more than zero

# Definition of reversible reactions
# Reversible reaction is used for
#	(i) output of metabolic flux distribution data
#	(ii) constrain metabolic flux
# 	(iii) investigate confidence intervals
# 	(iii) Composition of two or more reactions such as for the calculation of total ATP producton is supported.
# 1. id, text
#	Please use alphabet and numbers. Please do not use space and special characters to avoid unexpected errors.
# 2. forward reaction, text
#	Reacton id
#	Composition of reacton ids such as "v9+e1" is also supported.
#	Only "+" is accpectable separator.
# 3 . reverse reaction, text
#	Reacton id
#	Set "nothing" if there is no data

# Definition of Target compound
# Target compounds are metabolite out side of the metabolic model whose MDV are generarted by the calmdv function.
# 1. id, text
#	Please use alphabet and numbers. Please do not use space, "_" and other special characters to avoid unexpected errors.
# 2. type, text
#	"gcms" and "msms" are supported. "msms" mode is designed for the direct MS analysis of intermediates.
# 3. Carbon composition, text
#	"Glu_12345" indicated that the target compound has five carbons derived from 1-5th carbons of metabolite id "Glu".
#	In the "gcms"mode, "OAC_12+OAC_12" indicated that the target compound has for carbons derived from 1-2th carbons of metabolite id "OAC".
#	In the "msms"mode, "AKG_12345+AKG_1+AKG_2345" indicated carbon origins of "precursor ion" + "neutral loss2 + "product ion".
