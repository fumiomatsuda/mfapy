# Definition of reversible reactions
# Reversible reaction is used for
#	(i) output of metabolic flux distribution data
#	(ii) constrain metabolic flux
# 	(iii) investigate confidence intervals

# Definition of Target fragments
# Target fragments are metabolite out side of the metabolic model whose MDV are generarted by the calmdv function.
# 1. id, text
#	Please use alphabet and numbers. Please do not use space, "_" and other special characters to avoid unexpected errors.
# 2. type, text
#	"gcms" and "msms" are supported. "msms" mode is designed for the direct MS analysis of intermediates.
# 3. Carbon composition, text
#	"Glu_12345" indicated that the target compound has five carbons derived from 1-5th carbons of metabolite id "Glu".
#	In the "gcms"mode, "OAC_12+OAC_12" indicated that the target compound has for carbons derived from 1-2th carbons of metabolite id "OAC".
#	In the "msms"mode, "AKG_12345+AKG_1+AKG_2345" indicated carbon origins of "precursor ion" + "neutral loss2 + "product ion".
# 4. Usage, text
#	"use" means this target fragment is used in the analysis.  
# 5. Formula, text
#	Experimental, Chemical formula of target compound
