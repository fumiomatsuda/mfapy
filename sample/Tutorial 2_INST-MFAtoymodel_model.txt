# Definition of metabolic reactions
# 1. id, text
#	Please use alphabet (+ number) as ids. Do not use space and special characters to avoid unexpected errors.
# 2. Stoichiometry for the construicton of stoichiometry matrix, text
#	All id of metabolites must be defined in //Metabolites
#	Only "+" and "-->" are accpectable separators.
#	Here, expression of reaction using coefficient such as  "Fumx --> {2}OA" is allowed.
#	"nd" means this reaction is an "pseudo" reaction and ignored in the flux calculation of substrate by stoichiometry matrix.
# 3. Stoichiometry for the construicton of atom mapping, text
#	Only "+" and "-->" are accpectable separators.
#	Here, expression of reaction without using coefficient is needed such as  "Fumx --> OA+OA".
#	"nd" means this reaction is an excretion reaction and ignored in the MDV calculation
# 4. Atom mapping, text
#	Only "+" and "-->" are accpectable separators. Please use A-Z to express carbon atom.
#	"nd" means this reaction is an excretion reaction and ignored in the MDV calculation
# 5. Links to external ids (Optional)
#	Links to external ids can be described here
# 6. Lower boundary of metabolic flux level, float (Optional)
#	Value must be more than zero
# 7. Upper boundary of metabolic flux level, float (Optional)
#	Value must be more than zero
